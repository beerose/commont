# API Reference

- **config**: Configurable offset and limit for the server request. See
  [`UseCommentsConfig`](#use-comments-config)

### TypeScript Signature

```ts
const useComments: (
  projectId: string,
  postId: string,
  config?: UseCommentsConfig | undefined
) => UseComentsResult;
```

### Returns `UseComentsResult`

```ts
interface UseComentsResult {
  comments: Comment[];
  addComment: ({
    content,
    author,
  }: Pick<Comment, 'content' | 'author'>) => void;
  refetch: () => void;
  count: number;
  loading: boolean;
  error: UseCommentsError | null;
}
```

## `Comment`

```ts
export interface Comment {
  post_id: string;
  author: string;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  status?: CommentStatus;
}
```

## `UseCommentsConfig`

## `CommentStatus`

When user is adding a new comment it will be in one of four states:

  not yet visible for other people. You can make comments to require approval
  before being visible to others.

```ts
export declare type CommentStatus =

  | 'added'
  | 'delivered-awaiting-approval'
  | 'failed';
```
